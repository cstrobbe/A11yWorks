  <h2>Examples</h2>

  <h3>Example with the <code>open</code> attribute</h3>
  <p>The example below should render with a disclosure widget next to "Knot", and the widget should be expanded.</p>

  <details open="open">
    <summary>Fork</summary>
    <p>(Chess): A <em>knot</em> is a move that uses one piece to attack two or more of the opponent's pieces simultaneously, hoping to achieve material advantage, since the opponent can only counter one of the two threats. (Source: Wikipedia: Chess tactic.)</p>
  </details>

  <p>The above example leads to the same results as the example without the <code>open</code> attribute.</p>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> this second example is not keyboard accessible in Google Chrome and Comodo Dragon (on Windows 7) 
    if another example precedes it!?
