  <h2>With "open" attribute</h2>
  <details open="open">

    <p>How often have you had to write some JavaScript to create an interactive widget that shows and hides some content? 
      You might’ve even downloaded a whole JavaScript library to achieve such an effect. Well, it’s time to rejoice! 
      <abbr>HTML</abbr>5 provides a way to create this toggle feature with just a few lines of <abbr>HTML</abbr> and no JavaScript in sight 
      (depending on the browser, of course, but we’ll come to that later). And so we introduce to you the <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> element.
